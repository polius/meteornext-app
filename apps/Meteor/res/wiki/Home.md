**Meteor is a complete Python application to automatize the SQL Mass Deployment process making it easy and simple**

Meteor uses cutting-edge technologies like Parallel Executions which notably reduces the deployment duration in a logarithmic scale. Also allows to perform Cross-Region Executions avoiding transport delay.

Meteor is built leading to an end-to-end validation process to guarantee that no queries will harm any environment.

Tested in a real Production Environment using:

- MySQL (5.6 / 5.7)
- Amazon RDS for MySQL (5.6 / 5.7)
- Amazon Aurora MySQL (5.6 / 5.7)
- Amazon Aurora Serverless
